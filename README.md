# OASIS INFOBYTE INTERNSHIP
Welcome to the repository for Oasis Infobyte Data Science Internships! This repository is your go-to resource for the tasks assigned during the internship. 

TASK 1: IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION
        Iris flower has three species; setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differs according to their measurements. Now assume that you have the measurements of the             iris flowers according to their species, and here your task is to train a machine learning model that can learn from the measurements of the iris species and                 classify them.

TASK 2: UNEMPLOYMENT ANALYSIS WITH PYTHON
        Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate which is the number of people who are unemployed as a percentage of the total labour force. We have seen a sharp  
        increase in the unemployment rate during Covid-19, so analyzing the unemployment rate can be a good data science project. 
        Task overview
        1.Exploring the data
        2.data cleaning
        3.Data visualization
        4.correlation analysis
        
TASK 3: CAR PRICE PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING
        The price of a car depends on a lot of factors like the goodwill of the brand of the car, features of the car, horsepower and the mileage it gives and many more. Car         price prediction is one of the major research areas in machine learning. So if you want to learn how to train a car price prediction model then this project is for           you.
        1.Data cleaning and preprocessing
        2.Visualizing the Data
        3.Training a model: LINEAR REGRESSION, RANDOMFOREST REGRESSOR
        4.making prediction
        5.Evaluation
        6.comparing the model
        
TASK 4: EMAIL SPAM DETECTION WITH MACHINE LEARNING
        We’ve all been the recipient of spam emails before. Spam mail, or junk mail, is a type of email that is sent to a massive number of users at one time, frequently             containing cryptic messages, scams, or most dangerously, phishing content.
        In this Project, use Python to build an email spam detector. Then, use machine learning to train the spam detector to recognize and classify emails into spam and             non-spam.
        Task overview
        1. Exploring the data
        2. splitting the data
        3. Feature Extraction: TF-IDF Vectorizer
        4. Train a model
        5. prediction 
        6. Evaluation
Task 5: SALES PREDICTION USING PYTHON
        Sales prediction means predicting how much of a product people will buy based on factors such as the amount you spend to advertise your product, the segment of               people you advertise for, or the platform you are advertising on about your product. 
        Typically, a product and service-based business always need their Data Scientist to predict their future sales with every step they take to manipulate the cost of            advertising their product. So let’s start the task of sales prediction with machine learning using Python.
        Task overview
        1. Exploring the data
        2. visualizing the data
        3. Training a model
